# AGK-Playground
 
AGK Playground is a desktop tool that lets you experiment with a few AppGameKit commands and features in real time with a number of sliders and other UI components.

AGK Playground was created for a game jam on itch.io (https://digicodelabs.itch.io/agk-playground). The theme of the game jam was to create a tool that would be useful to developers making games. It was created in AGK (https://appgamekit.com)

In the version released for the game jam you can play around with 2D particles, as well as the math commands: sin and cos. Once you're happy with the configuration you've chosen you can copy and paste the code right in to your own game.
